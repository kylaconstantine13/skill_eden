Copyright © 2018 Andrew Grill, Johnny Li, Lucas Petherbridge, Mackenzie Wangenstein

Skill Eden is a skill planning tool that helps new players get their characters up to speed in their desired area of gameplay as quickly as possible. EVE is full of many different playstyles and metagaming which do not have clear training paths inside the game to be able to competently participate in.

Skill Eden will offer a list of metagame playstyles grouped by various categories from which the user can select and create training plans around. These metagame playstyles will include helpful descriptions and tips which will be greatly beneficial to newer players who may be unfamiliar with the many and varied aspects of the game. The user will then be able to see the amount of time required to train in their chosen plans, the skills required, and the estimated cost of skill books. If the user chooses to provide an API key, Skill Eden will take the characters existing skills and attributes into account to properly estimate the training time required and the cost of missing skill books.
